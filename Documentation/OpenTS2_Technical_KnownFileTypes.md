## Music Stream Content (MSC) Files
These files are loaded and handled by the _FRD Stream Driver_ (**v1.1** in the OPM 53 demo).

## Raw Files
_Free Radical Design_ used a generic `.raw` file extension for regular binary data (animations, skeletons, etc).

There is no specific format for all `.raw` files, the game's code is hardcoded to treat certain raw files differently.
